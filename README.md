# EPICS Support for the MQTT protocol

This module provides an EPICS driver for the MQTT protocol, allowing EPICS clients to communicate with MQTT brokers and
devices directly from EPICS.

Contributions are welcome - feel free to open issues and pull requests!

## Features

- Auto-update of EPICS PVS via `I/O Intr` records;
- Support for read/write flat MQTT topics (i.e, topics where the payload is a single value or array);
- Support for reading JSON payloads;
- Support for MQTT QoS levels;
- Checks and reject invalid messages (based mostly on type-checking);
- Auto reconnection of broker;
- Planned - short term:
  - Support for MQTT retained messages.
  - Support for MQTT last will messages.
  - Support for MQTT authentication and TLS.

> Note: Virtually all features from the
> [Paho C++ MQTT client](https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/client.html) are available to be
> implemented in this driver, so feel free to open an issue if you need a specific feature.

This module is built on top of [Cosylab autoparamDriver](https://epics.cosylab.com/documentation/autoparamDriver/),
which uses [the standard asyn interfaces](https://epics-modules.github.io/asyn/asynDriver.html#generic-interfaces) for
device support. For now, the supported interfaces are the following:

- `asynInt32`
- `asynFloat64`
- `asynUInt32Digital`
- `asynOctet`
- `asynInt32Array`
- `asynFloat64Array`
  > See [Implementation status](#implementation-status) to check the status of development of the interface you need.

## Building the module

1. Install the dependencies:
   > Tested with the following versions.
   - EPICS Base 7.0.8.1: https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/releases/tag/R7.0.8.1
   - Asyn 4.45: https://github.com/epics-modules/asyn/releases/tag/R4-45
   - autoparamDriver 2.0.0: https://github.com/Cosylab/autoparamDriver/releases/tag/v2.0.0
   - Paho 1.5.3: Follow
     [these](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#build-the-paho-c-and-paho-c-libraries-together)
     instructions.

> Note: AutoparamDriver explicitly requires EPICS >= 7.0, see
> [reference](https://github.com/Cosylab/autoparamDriver/blob/main/autoparamDriverSup/src/Makefile#L15). For this
> reason, this module requires EPICS 7.0 or later to be built and used.

2. Clone this repository:

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/AndreFavotto/epicsMQTT.git
```

3. Edit the `configure/RELEASE` file to include your paths to the dependencies:

   ```shell
   EPICS_BASE = /path/to/epics/base
   ASYN = /path/to/asyn
   AUTOPARAM = /path/to/autoparamDriver
   PAHO_CPP_INC = /path/to/paho/cpp/include #by default, should be /usr/local/include
   PAHO_CPP_LIB = /path/to/paho/cpp/lib     #by default, should be /usr/local/lib
   ```

   > For now we have two macros for setting paho path because we build the module with separate linking flags -I and -L,
   > but this might change soon.

4. Run `make`. The library should now be ready for [usage](#usage).

## Usage

1. Include the module in your IOC build instructions:
   - Add asyn and mqtt to your `configure/RELEASE` file:

     ```shell
     ## Other definitions ...
     ASYN = /path/to/asyn
     MQTT = /path/to/epicsMqtt
     ## Other definitions ...
     ```

   - Add the mqtt database definition and include the necessary libraries to your `yourApp/src/Makefile`:
     ```shell
     #### Other commands ...
     yourIOC_DBD += mqtt.dbd
     #### Other commands ...
     yourIOC_LIBS += asyn
     yourIOC_LIBS += mqttSupport
     ```

2. In your database file, link the EPICS records and the MQTT topics through the `INP` and `OUT` fields. The syntax is
   as follows:

```shell
  field(INP|OUT, "@asyn(<PORT>) <FORMAT>:<TYPE> <TOPIC> [<FIELD>]")
```

Where:

- `<PORT>` is the name of the asyn port defined in the `asynPortDriver` configuration.
- `<FORMAT>` is the format of the payload: `FLAT` or `JSON`.
- `<TYPE>` is the general type of the expected value [`INT|FLOAT|DIGITAL|STRING|INTARRAY|FLOATARRAY`].
- `<TOPIC>` is the MQTT topic to which the record will be subscribed/published.
- `<FIELD>` is JSON pointer to extract value from a JSON payload (e.g. `/sensor/temperature`). If empty, JSON root is
  used.

> **Note on JSON write:** JSON write currently publishes the record value as a plain JSON scalar/array. Composing JSON
> objects within the driver is not yet supported (see [#14](https://github.com/epics-modules/mqtt/issues/14)). To write
> a structured JSON payload, compose it at the application level using a `FLAT:STRING` record and a `scalcout` record.

**Important: Due to the pub/sub nature of MQTT, ALL input records are expected to be `I/O Intr`.**

Example:

```console
record(ai, "$(P)$(R)AnalogIn"){
  field(DESC, "Analog Input Record")
  field(DTYP, "asynInt32")
  field(SCAN, "I/O Intr")
  field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT)) FLAT:INT test/analogtopic")
}

record(ai, "$(P)$(R)AnalogOut"){
  field(DESC, "Analog Output Record")
  field(DTYP, "asynInt32")
  field(OUT, "@asyn($(PORT)) FLAT:INT test/analogtopic")
}
```

> Note: Several examples can be found in [mqttExampleApp/Db](mqttExampleApp/Db/example.db) for other record types.

3. Load the module in your startup script using the following syntax:

```cpp
 mqttDriverConfigure(const char *portName, const char *brokerUrl, const char *mqttClientID, const int qos)
```

Example:

```shell
  # (... other startup commands ...)
  epicsEnvSet("PORT", "test")
  epicsEnvSet("BROKER_URL", "mqtt://localhost:1883")
  epicsEnvSet("CLIENT_ID", "mqttEpics")
  epicsEnvSet("QOS", "1")
  mqttDriverConfigure($(PORT), $(BROKER_URL), $(CLIENT_ID), $(QOS))
  # (... other startup commands ...)
  dbLoadRecords("your_database.db", "PORT=$(PORT)")
  iocInit()
```
